This is the actual script for my talk. It's going to be in a lot of flux as I attempt to write this.

Good morning/afternoon. How is everybody doing? Awake? Exhausted?

> TODO: Insert joke slides here for intro. Maybe a picture of the IRT booth.

I'm Brian Meeker. I'm a software developer for InfernoRed Technology. I work as a consultant, mostly in .NET and JS/Typescript, but also a bunch of other things. My official title is Engineering Wizard, but I'm a jack of all trades, master of none kind of guy. Stop by the InfernoRed booth if you want to chat about this talk or any other cool stuff you've seen at CodeMash this week.

So, you're here for a history talk. What makes me qualified to give a history talk? This is me putting my imaginary history minor to use. You see, I took all the courses to get a history minor, but never actually talked to anybody in the history department about it, so... no minor for me. But I put in all the work, and I think that's the important part. I'm pretty sure that avoiding the paperwork and the human interaction required to complete a task is the most stereotypical software developer behavior you can imagine.

I also want to thank Jenny Manning for doing her talk CodeMash 2019 - _Mommy, where do new programming languages come from?_ last year. Her talk was the inspiration for me submitting this talk and speaking here this year.

Let's step back though and talk about the dark ages. The before time. The time before version control.

So, what is version control?

> TODO: Insert definition of version control here. What criteria needs to be met to qualify as version control?

> TODO: Insert discussion of systems that pre-date SCCS. They met some of the criteria, but not all.

> Insert let there be light slide and/or 2001 black monolith slide.

Like most ideas, there are a lot of pre-cursors that had some elements of version control, but it's widely agreed that SCCS is the first true version control system. The systems that existed before SCCS were mostly about deltas. And while deltas are extremely valuable, but they do not make a version control system.
