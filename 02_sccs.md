Like most ideas, there are a lot of pre-cursors that had some elements of version control, but it's widely agreed that SCCS is the first true version control system. The systems that existed before SCCS were mostly about deltas. And while deltas are extremely valuable, but they do not make a version control system.

Unfortunately, my research failed me when trying to find any detailed information about pre-cursors to SCCS. I know that systems like IBM's CLEAR (Controlled Library Environment and Resources) and DEC's CMS existed, but I wasn't able to find out much beyond that.

There is a little bit of information about CLEAR from a software engineering technique's conference sponsored by the NATO Science Committee in 1969. CLEAR was a larger system that "tried to assist with the administration and accomplishment of the program development cycle." (http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1969.PDF pg. 40) One part of that system used deltas to help with versioning releases, but I was not able to find any other information.
