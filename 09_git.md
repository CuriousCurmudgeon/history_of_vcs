   was consciously trying to not do a BK clone. I wanted to do the same 
   things that BK did, but I very much did _not_ want to do them the _way_ 
   BK did them. I respect Larry too much, and I didn't want there to be 
   any question about git being just a "clone".

   designs on purpose, and I think that really helped. The fact that I 
   didn't have a background in SCM's, and that I thought all the weaves 
   etc were confusing, meant that I instead went for a radically different 
   way of doing things.

   to do. That was what allowed git to really soar. A lot of the good 
   things in git come exactly from the fact that git does _not_ do things 
   like most traditional SCM's do. But BK should still get a lot of 
   credit, because it was what taught me (and a lot of other people) what 
   being "distributed" really meant.

things are, it becomes a big part of usability.
